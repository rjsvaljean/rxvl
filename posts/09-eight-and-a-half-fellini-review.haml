    %p 'Honesty' would be my one word sum up of Fredrico Fellini’s ‘8½’. Never before have I seen a film that realises that word so perfectly in every scene, in every character and down to every shot. OK with that introduction lets take this film apart from the top.
  .main
    %p The film, inspite of being rife in its symbolism and liberal use of flashbacks and montages comes apart very easily, in that, it is hardly the intellectual high brow film that you would expect - going by the spate of recent films that employ those techniques. It is disarming in its honesty. You go in with intellectual equivalent of nuclear war heads, expecting to have to struggle with each scene to get at the vision of the film and appreciate Fellini’s genius. Instead you are greeted by a director who has cast aside his bag of tricks and decided to tell his story honestly without any agenda.
    %p Films often try to deliver powerful messages with beautiful cinematography, talented actors and well thought out scripts but at the end of the day one realises that its still a bunch of people dressing up and playing pretend. Our unwitting protagonist here is Guido Anselmi, a troubled yet highly successful director, struggling to cough up his magnum opus in the face of a creative block, bellowing producers, whiny actors, personal battles and childhood demons. Guido plays many roles in the fillm. One minute he is the indebted son, forever bound by guilt to his parents, who constantly remind him of what they have done for him and how he has failed to meet their un-attainable expectations(explicitly by his mother and passive agressively by his father). A few scenes later he is the adulterer husband who desperately seeks his wife’s love. Further along, he plays the beaten intellectual who just can’t grasp that ray of light that shines so clearly before him. He turns to religion, philosophy, work and friends for answers in vain.
    %p The film is almost entirely character-driven to the point that you forget for the period of the film that they are really just characters. It does give us some colourful characters in the capitilistic producer, the scorned wife, the ever-buoyant lover, the contemptuous writer, the holier-than-thou members of the religious and a grab bag bunch of performers and artists, each with their slightly exaggerated neuroses. Inspite of the strength of each character and the skill with which they are portrayed, the core vision of the film draws from this rather than be affected by it.
    %p The parallel between what Guido hopes to achieve and the tone of the film that we see is so stark and all-prevading that it hardly seems to be the subtext but rather the unstated note of information that preceeds the film that says in no uncertain terms: “This film is based on me in every conceivable way”. And because of this unique alignment of the message of the film and the mode of presentation of the message in the film 8½ has a ring of honesty and adequacy that is sorely lacking in much of contemporary cinema.
